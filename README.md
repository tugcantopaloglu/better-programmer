# A little bit better every day!
  Trying to be better programmer and ethical hacker. A little bit better every day. Daily challenges and exercises. Mostly coding exercises but this repository has cracked machine solutions (some manuals how to crack them) for HTB and TryHackMe and more. Some small projects which can improve my programming and engineering skills. You can use this repository as an example for your journey if you want! Feel free to contribute more exercises, sites and programs for developing more!
